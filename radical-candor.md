# My notes on Radical Candor

Literally all of this book was valuable, so... notes will be all over the place. Let's go.

# What this book solves

## Management is your job.
> “Is my job to build a great company,” I asked, “or am I really just some sort of emotional babysitter?” Leslie, a fiercely opinionated ex-Microsoft executive, could barely contain herself. “This is not babysitting,” she said. “It’s called management, and it is your job!” Every time I feel I have something more “important” to do than listen to people, I remember Leslie’s words: “It is your job!” I’ve used Leslie’s line on dozens of new managers who’ve come to me after a few weeks in their new role, moaning that they feel like “babysitters” or “shrinks.”

Listening & caring deeply about your employees is your job.

## You are the boss.
> I prefer the word “boss” because the distinctions between leadership and management tend to define leaders as BSers who don’t actually do anything and managers as petty executors. Also, there’s a problematic hierarchical difference implied in the two words, as if leaders no longer have to manage when they achieve a certain level of success, and brand-new managers don’t have to lead.

### You are responsible for your team's results.
> Ultimately, though, bosses are responsible for results. They achieve these results not by doing all the work themselves but by guiding the people on their teams. Bosses guide a team to achieve results.

### This book helps if you face these problems.

- Guidance: People dread feedback—both the praise, which can feel patronizing, and especially the criticism.
- Team-building: Building a cohesive team means figuring out the right people for the right roles: hiring, firing, promoting. But once you’ve got the right people in the right jobs, how do you keep them motivated?
- Results: Many managers are perpetually frustrated that it seems harder than it should be to get things done.

## Your responsibilities as manager.

- Creating a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that keeps the team moving in the right direction.
- Understanding what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredom and keep the team cohesive.
- Driving results collaboratively.

If you think that you can do these things without strong relationships, you are kidding yourself.

Your ability to build trusting, human connections with the people who report directly to you will determine the quality of everything that follows. Defining those relationships is vital. They’re deeply personal, and they’re not like any other relationships in your life. But most of us are at a loss when we set about to build those relationships.

# The dimensions of Radical Candor
- Care personally: giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self and encouraging your direct reports to do the same. 
- Challenge directly: telling people when their work isn't good enough -- and when it is.

Radical Candor is what happens when you put "Care Personally" and "Challenge Directly" together.

## Why is this a good idea?

It turns out that when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to:

1. Accept and act on your praise and criticism
2. Tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well
3. Engage in this same behavior with one another, meaning less pushing the rock up the hill again and again
4. Embrace their role on the team
5. Focus on getting results.

The most surprising thing about Radical Candor may be that its results are often the opposite of what you fear. You fear people will become angry or vindictive; instead they are usually grateful for the chance to talk it through. And even when you do get that initial anger, resentment, or sullenness, those emotions prove to be fleeting when the person knows you really care.

## On "keeping things professional"
Part of the reason why people fail to “care personally” is the injunction to “keep it professional.” That phrase denies something essential. We are all human beings, with human feelings, and, even at work, we need to be seen as such. When that doesn’t happen, when we feel we must repress who we really are to earn a living, we become alienated. That makes us hate going to work. To most bosses, being professional means: show up at work on time, do your job, don’t show feelings (unless engaged in “motivation” or some such end-driven effort). The result is that nobody feels comfortable being who they really are at work.

## Bring your whole self to work.
This often means modeling the behavior yourself by showing some vulnerability to the people who report to you—or just admitting when you’re having a bad day—and creating a safe space for others to do the same.

## Finding humanity @ work.
It’s about acknowledging that we are all people with lives and aspirations that extend beyond those related to our shared work. It’s about finding time for real conversations; about getting to know each other at a human level; about learning what’s important to people; about sharing with one another what makes us want to get out of bed in the morning and go to work—and what has the opposite effect.

## You will invoke emotions.
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell once remarked that being responsible sometimes means pissing people off.

You have to accept that sometimes people on your team will be mad at you. **In fact, if nobody is ever mad at you, you probably aren’t challenging your team enough.** The key, as in any relationship, is how you handle the anger. When what you say hurts, acknowledge the other person’s pain. Don’t pretend it doesn’t hurt or say it “shouldn’t” hurt—just show that you care. 

**Eliminate the phrase “don’t take it personally” from your vocabulary—it’s insulting. Instead, offer to help fix the problem. But don’t pretend it isn’t a problem just to try to make somebody feel better. In the end, caring personally about people even as you challenge them will build the best relationships of your career.**

## Leave behind authoritarianism.
The hardest part of building this trust is inviting people to challenge you, just as directly as you are challenging them. You have to encourage them to challenge you directly enough that you may be the one who feels upset or angry. 

This takes some getting used to—particularly for more “authoritarian” leaders. But if you stick to it, you’ll find that you learn a great deal about yourself and how people perceive you. This knowledge will unfailingly allow you and your team to achieve better results.

## Not a license to be a fucking jerk.
Radical Candor is not a license to be gratuitously harsh or to “front-stab.” It’s not Radical Candor just because you begin with the words, “Let me be Radically Candid with you.” If you follow that phrase with words like, “You are a liar and I don’t trust you,” or “You’re a dipshit,” you’ve just acted like a garden-variety jerk. 

It’s not Radical Candor if you don’t show that you care personally.

## Not a license to suck up.
Radical Candor is not about schmoozing, nor is it about endless extroversion that exhausts the introverts on your team or wears you out if you happen to be the introvert. It’s not about getting drunk or driving go-carts or playing laser tag or having endless dinners with colleagues. Those might be good ways to blow off steam, but activities like that take up a lot of time and are not the most efficient way to help you get to know the people you work with, or show them you care personally.

# Creating a culture of communication

## The `um` story

> “You are going to have an amazing career here at Google,” Sheryl began. She knew how to get my attention—I had three failed start-ups under my belt and badly needed a win. “And your ability to be intellectually honest about both sides of an argument, not just your own, bought you a lot of credibility in there.” She mentioned three or four specific things I’d said to illustrate her point. I’d been worried that I wasn’t arguing my points vehemently enough, so this was welcome news to me.

> She wanted me to register that something I’d been worried about being a weakness was actually a strength. This was interesting, but I wanted to file it away to think about later.

> Sheryl laughed. “You always want to focus on what you could have done better. Which I understand. I do, too. We learn more from failure than success. But I want you to focus for a minute on what went well, because overall it really did go well. This was a success.”

> I listened as best I could. Finally, she said. “You said ‘um’ a lot. Were you aware of it?”

> “Was it because you were nervous? Would you like me to recommend a speech coach for you? Google will pay for it.”

> Sheryl laughed. “When you do that thing with your hand, I feel like you’re ignoring what I’m telling you. I can see I am going to have to be really, really direct to get through to you. You are one of the smartest people I know, but saying ‘um’ so much makes you sound stupid.”

Even though the overall talk had gone well, Sheryl didn’t let the positive result get in the way of pointing out something that needed fixing.

## Show that you care.

When you criticize someone without taking even two seconds to show you care, your guidance feels obnoxiously aggressive to the recipient. I regret to say that if you can’t be Radically Candid, being obnoxiously aggressive is the second best thing you can do.

When bosses criticize others to humiliate them rather than to help them improve, or permit personalized attacks among team members, or discourage praise as “babysitting people’s egos,” their behavior feels obnoxiously aggressive to the people around him.

## Don't be an ass.
The worst kind of Obnoxious Aggression happens when one person really understands another’s vulnerabilities and then targets them, either for sport or to assert dominance. I once had a boss who really knew how to push my buttons—he possessed what I thought of as “cruel empathy.” Almost nothing will erode trust more quickly than using one’s insights into what makes another person tick to hurt them.

> The incident with Larry is a good example of how criticism can be obnoxiously aggressive if you don’t care personally. I probably thought I was being Radically Candid—“speaking truth to power”—but I wasn’t. It was a clear-cut case of “front-stabbing.” Better than backstabbing, but still really bad.

## Don't give obnoxious praise.
Praise can be obnoxiously aggresive. 

> Imagine how Person 33 felt when he saw that his private compensation information had been sent out to six hundred people. I doubt it made him feel better to learn that he was being paid half of what he should have been and that his boss thought he was probably looking for other jobs!

## Don't give guidance if you don't care enough to challenge directly.
People give praise and criticism that is manipulatively insincere when they are too focused on being liked or think they can gain some sort of political advantage by being fake—or when they are just too tired to care or argue any more. 

Guidance that is manipulatively insincere rarely reflects what the speaker actually thinks; rather, it’s an attempt to push the other person’s emotional buttons in return for some personal gain.

> Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive told a story about a time when he pulled his punches when criticizing his team’s work. When Steve Jobs asked Jony why he hadn’t been more clear about what was wrong, Jony replied, “Because I care about the team.” To which Steve replied, “No, Jony, you’re just really vain. You just want people to like you.” Recounting the story, Jony said, “I was terribly cross because I knew he was right.”

That’s why Colin Powell said leadership is sometimes about being willing to piss people off. 

When you are overly worried about how people will perceive you, you’re less willing to say what needs to be said. Like Jony, you may feel it’s because you care about the team, but really, in those all-too-human moments you may care too much about how they feel about you—in other words, about yourself. I’ve been there, too. We all have.

# Challenging & invoking emotions is giving a damn.
Give a damn about the people you challenge. 

Worrying about whether or not they give a damn about you, however, is not “caring personally” about them, and it’s likely to push you in the wrong direction on the “challenge directly” axis. 

That’s not going to help your team achieve great results, or take a step in the direction of their dreams. Let go of vanity and care personally. But if you don’t care, don’t waste your time and everyone else’s by trying to fake it.

## Ruinous Empathy
When bosses are too invested in everyone getting along, they also fail to encourage the people on their team to criticize one another for fear of sowing discord. They create the kind of work environment where “being nice” is prioritized at the expense of critiquing, and therefore, improving actual performance.

Bosses often make the mistake of thinking that if they hang out in the Ruinous Empathy quadrant they can build a relationship with their direct reports and then move over to Radical Candor. They’re pleasant to work with, but as time goes by their employees start to realize that the only guidance they’ve received is “good job” and other vaguely positive comments. 

On the flip side, when Ruinous Empathy prevents bosses from soliciting criticism, they have no idea anything is wrong until a person quits. Needless to say, this strategy does not build trust on either side.

# Build a culture that challenges everyone.
There are several reasons why it makes sense to begin building a culture of Radical Candor by asking people to criticize you. 

- First, it’s the best way to show that you are aware that you are often wrong, and that you want to hear about it when you are; you want to be challenged. 
- Second, you’ll learn a lot—few people scrutinize you as closely as do those who report to you.
- Third, the more firsthand experience you have with how it feels to receive criticism, the better idea you’ll have of how your own guidance lands for others. - Fourth, asking for criticism is a great way to build trust and strengthen your relationships.

## On praising
Praise guides people in the right direction. 

It’s just as important to let people know what to do more of as what to do less of. It also encourages people to keep improving. In other words, the best praise does a lot more than just make people feel good. It can actually challenge them directly.

## Just say it
> When I am criticizing, I try to be less nervous, and focus on “just saying it.” If I think too much about how to say it I’m likely to wimp out and say nothing. And when I am praising, I try to be at least aware of how praise can go wrong, and put more energy into thinking about how to say it.

## Dissecting Jobs' criticism style
> JOBS: The most important thing I think you can do for somebody who’s really good and who’s really being counted on is to point out to them when they’re not—when their work isn’t good enough. And to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track.

He’s careful not to personalize the criticism—not to say “when they’re not good enough.” Instead, he says “when their work isn’t good enough.”

Everyone must find their own way to criticize people without discouraging them. Steve Jobs’s guidance style is certainly not for everyone, but it’s worth understanding where he was coming from.

## A trick for saying really difficult things
> When you’re faced with telling a person something that will be extremely hard to hear, pretend you’re just saying, “Your fly is down,” or “You have spinach in your teeth.” These less-fraught scenarios can help you approach bigger problems more straightforwardly.

Then next time you spot a metaphorical fly down and are tempted not to say anything, imagine where that puts you on the framework: Ruinous Empathy or Manipulative Insincerity? The little jolt might just move you toward Radical Candor.

## Don't repress yourself! Challenge!
From the moment you learned to speak, you started to challenge those around you. Then you were told some version of “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” Well, now it’s your job to say it. 

**And if you are a boss or a person in a position of some authority, it’s not just your job. It’s your moral obligation. Just say it!**

Well, stop repressing your innate ability to care personally. Give a damn!

# Understand your team.

## Rock stars vs. superstars
**Rock stars are solid as a rock.** Think the Rock of Gibraltar, not Bruce Springsteen. The rock stars love their work. They have found their groove. They don’t want the next job if it will take them away from their craft. Not all artists want to own a gallery; in fact, most don’t. If you honor and reward the rock stars, they’ll become the people you most rely on. If you promote them into roles they don’t want or aren’t suited for, however, you’ll lose them—or, even worse, wind up firing them. 

**Superstars, on the other hand, need to be challenged and given new opportunities to grow constantly.**

## It's about growth, not potential.
> Scott proposed using the word “growth” instead of “potential,” to help managers think about what opportunities to give to which people on their teams. Changing one word made a world of difference. 

Instead of asking an implicitly judgmental question like, “Is this a person with high or low potential?” we encouraged managers to ask themselves questions like, “What growth trajectory does each person on my team want to be on right now?” or “Have I given everybody opportunities that are in line with what they really want?”

This set of questions around growth trajectory can help you discover what motivates each person much better than a set of questions around “potential” or “talent” could. And the insights it produces will help you avoid burning out the rock stars and boring the superstars.

## Know your direct reports & understand their ambitions.
**The most important thing you can do for your team collectively is to understand what growth trajectory each person wants to be on at a given time and whether that matches the needs and opportunities of the team. To do that, you are going to have to get to know each of your direct reports at a personal level.**

## Don't force passion, acknowledge the shit
Insisting that people have passion for their job can place unnecessary pressure on both boss and employee. 

> I struggled with this at Google, where we were hiring people right out of college to do dull customer-support work. I tried convincing them that we were “funding creativity a nickel at a time.” One young woman who’d studied philosophy in college, called BS immediately. “Look, the job is a little boring,” she said. “Let’s just admit that. It’s OK. Plutarch laid bricks. Spinoza ground lenses. Tedium is part of life.” I loved her approach to finding meaning, but it was unique to her. A slogan like “Spinoza ground lenses” would not have been inspiring for the broader team.

There’s nothing wrong with working hard to earn a paycheck that supports the life you want to lead. That has plenty of meaning.

> A wise man once told me, “Only about five percent of people have a real vocation in life, and they confuse the hell out of the rest of us.”

## Assessing direct reports
When assessing a person’s past performance, it’s useful to consider both their results and more intangible things like “teamwork.” The expected results for a given quarter or year are ideally set by the employee; they should be as objective and as measurable as possible. The intangibles are usually impossible to measure but not too hard to describe, and so expectations should be clear here as well. Performance is not a permanent label. No person is always an “excellent performer.” They just performed excellently last quarter.

## Don't ignore people.
One of the most common mistakes bosses make is to ignore the people who are doing the best work because “they don’t need me” or “I don’t want to micromanage.” Ignoring somebody is a terrible way to build a relationship.

> “That’s like saying, to have a good marriage, marry the right person and then avoid spending any time with them. Ridiculous, right?” he exclaimed. “Imagine if I went home and told my wife, ‘I don’t want to micromanage you, so I’m not going to spend any time with you or the kids this year.’”

Ignore these people and you won’t, in short, be managing.

## Be a partner.
You don’t want to be an absentee manager any more than you want to be a micromanager. 

**Instead, you want to be a partner—that is, you must take the time to help the people doing the best work overcome obstacles and make their good work even better.** This is time-consuming because it requires that you know enough about the details of the person’s work to understand the nuances.

## Handling recognition
For too many bosses, “recognition” means “promotion.” But in most cases, this is a big mistake. Promotion often puts these people in roles they are not as well-suited for or don’t want.

> In addition to top ratings, a great way to recognize people in a rock star phase is to **designate them as “gurus,” or “go-to” experts**. Often this means putting them in charge of teaching newer team members, if they show the aptitude for it.

Life is so much better when people are great at their work and love it. The idea of climbing a corporate ladder is not inspiring to plenty of people. And yet those on a gradual growth trajectory are often referred to pejoratively as “B-players,” or as having “capped out.”

> Part of building a cohesive team is to create a culture that recognizes and rewards the rock stars. I’m afraid for most of my career I treated them like second-class citizens.

## Keeping each camp happy
- The best way to keep superstars happy is to challenge them and make sure they are constantly learning. It’s vital not to “squash” these people. Recognize that you’ll probably be working for them one day, and celebrate that fact.
- The best way to keep rockstars happy is to keep them stable.

## Sometimes firing someone is the best you can do
Lots of people never find work they are truly excellent at because they stay in the wrong job so long that any change would require a step or two backward.

Sometimes, people just needed to be thrown out of the nest to spread their wings. In all cases, the people wound up much happier, even though making a change was hard.

Also, when somebody is performing poorly and, having received clear communication about the nature of the problem, is showing no signs of improvement, you must fire that person.

## The point
**Your job is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from their work.**

In many ways, your job as the boss is to set and uphold a quality bar. That can feel harsh in the short term, but in the long run the only thing that is meaner is lowering the bar.

# The Hard Stuff

## Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing someone
- **"It will get better."** Stop and ask yourself: how, exactly, will it get better? It probably won't.
- **"Someone is better than nobody."** Poor performers create extra work for others. It's better to have a hole than an asshole.
- **"A transfer is the answer."** This is generally a mistake: it feels nicer, but it's a net negative.
- **"It's bad for morale."** Keeping someone who can't do the job is far worse for morale. 

## Being radically candid when firing
- Recall a job you were terrible at and think how glad you feel that you’re no longer in it.
- Retaining people who are doing bad work penalizes the people doing excellent work.

##  Give a shit
> I had a family crisis while I was working for Sheryl Sandberg. I will always be grateful for her response: “Get on a plane, go home, take all the time you need, and don’t worry about anything at Google.

## Don't classify people
> My biggest concern with the terms “rock star” and “superstar” is that you’ll use them as permanent labels for people. Please do not! It’s tempting to see certain people as fit only for a certain role or having a certain set of skills/weaknesses that will never change. The truth is, people really do change.

> To combat permanent labels, Qualtrics cofounder (and my colleague from Juice and Google) Jared Smith came up with the performance ratings “off quarter,” “solid quarter,” and “exceptional quarter.”

# Telling people what to do doesn't work.
If you want your team to achieve something bigger than you could achieve alone, if you want to “burst the bounds of your brain,” you have to care about the people you are working with. You’ll get more done if you take the time to incorporate their thinking into yours, and yours into theirs.

> On the one hand, I loved Google’s approach and subscribed to the Antoine de Saint-Exupéry school of management: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.”

## Strong opinions, weakly held
It’s hard enough to get yourself to listen to your team members and let them know you are listening; getting them to listen to one another is even harder. The keys are 1) have a simple system for employees to use to generate ideas and voice complaints, 2) make sure that at least some of the issues raised are quickly addressed, and 3) regularly offer explanations as to why the other issues aren’t being addressed.

> If you can build a culture where people listen to one another, they will start to fix things you as the boss never even knew were broken.

## Editor, not author
Once you've created a culture of listening, the next step is to push yourself and your direct reports to understand and convey thoughts and ideas more clearly. Trying to solve a problem that hasn’t been clearly defined is not likely to result in a good solution; debating a half-baked idea is likely to kill it. As the boss, you are the editor, not the author.

> New ideas don’t have to be grandiose plans for the next iPad. Your team may be saying something like, “I’m frustrated by this process,” or “I’m not feeling as energized by my work as I was,” or “I think our sales pitch could be stronger,” or “I’d do better work if there were more natural light in the office,” or “What if we just stopped doing X?” or “I’d like to start working on Y.”

## Clarify, clarify, clarify
It’s important to push the people on your team to clarify their thinking and ideas so that you don’t “squish” their best thinking or ignore problems that are bothering them. It’s not just important to understand new ideas clearly; it’s equally important, and often more difficult, to understand the people to whom your team will have to explain the ideas clearly.

There are also great ideas that look bad at first blush. A good brainstorming session distinguishes between the two without killing too many good ideas or wasting too much time on the bad ones.

## 1:1 time is a safe space
Less dramatic than these kinds of formalized meetings and programs are your weekly 1:1s. These meetings should be a safe place for your direct reports to come and talk to you about new ideas. 

In this context, you shouldn’t judge the ideas but rather help your direct reports clarify their thinking. This is a form of “plussing.” You can point out problems but with the aim of figuring a way around those problems, not killing ideas.

> The next time you spend two hours helping somebody edit an email until it’s just two sentences, don’t feel you are wasting your time. You are getting to the essence of the idea, which allows the recipient to absorb it quickly and easily. And you are teaching an invaluable skill.

## Debate time is essential.
> Your job as a boss is to turn on that “rock tumbler.” Too many bosses think their role is to turn it off—to avoid all the friction by simply making a decision and sparing the team the pain of debate. It’s not. Debate takes time and requires emotional energy. But lack of debate saps a team of more time and emotional energy in the long run.

If you skip the debate phase, you’ll make worse decisions, you’ll be unable to persuade everyone who needs to execute, and you’ll ultimately slow down or grind to a halt. Once again, you don’t have to be in every debate—in fact, you shouldn’t be. But you’ve got to make sure that they happen, and that there is a culture of debate on your team.

## No time for ego in debate
Make sure that individual egos and self-interest don’t get in the way of an objective quest for the best answer.

Remind people what the goal is: to get to the best answer, as a team. You’re creating a collaboration of great minds, not monitoring a high school debate competition or running a presidential election. If you have to, set ground rules at the beginning of the meeting, or—if your team would find it amusing and useful rather than ridiculous—put a prop like an “ego coat check” outside the door.

## Obligation to dissent
The sixth man. 

> McKinsey had very consciously created an “obligation to dissent.” If everyone around the table agreed, that was a red flag. Somebody had to take up the dissenting voice. McKinsey alums often brought this with them into the companies they later worked for. One ex-McKinsey executive at Apple struggled to foster a culture of debate on a team he inherited in Japan. He had a bunch of gavels made up with “duty to dissent” written in Japanese on them. If there wasn’t a robust enough argument in a meeting, he’d slide the gavel across the table to someone, as a sign to take up the opposite point of view. This simple prop was surprisingly effective.

## Acknowledge emotions when debating.
There are times when people are just too tired, burnt out, or emotionally charged up to engage in productive debate. It’s crucial to be aware of these moments, because they rarely lead to good outcomes. Your job is to intervene and call a time-out. If you don’t, people will make a decision so that they can go home; or worse, a huge fight stemming from raw emotions will break out. 

If you’ve gotten to know each person on your team well enough, you’ll be sufficiently aware of everyone’s emotions and energies so that you’ll know when it’s necessary to step in and defer the debate till people are in a better frame of mind.

## Separate debate and decision meetings
One way to avoid this tension is to separate debate meetings and decision meetings. Another way to ease the anxiety of the people who want to know when the decision will get made is to have a “decide by” date next to each item being debated. Then at least they know when the debate will end and the decision will be made.

## Debate can get difficult.
It’s tempting to end debates and make a decision too soon when a debate becomes too painful. You might be creeping up on a topic that’s been a subject of great contention. At times like this, people often look to the boss to end the suffering and make a decision. 

> My instinct is to be a peacemaker, or to get to a decision quickly. But a boss’s job is often to keep the debate going rather than to resolve it with a decision. It’s the debates at work that help individuals grow and help the team work better collectively to come up with the best answer.

## Set decide by dates.
Deadlines help ease debate.

# Decisions
## Decisions should be taken by those closest to the facts.
That is why kick-ass bosses often do not decide themselves, but rather create a clear decision-making process that empowers people closest to the facts to make as many decisions as possible. Not only does that result in better decisions, it results in better morale.

## Facts, not recommendations
When collecting information for a decision, we are often tempted to ask people for their recommendations—“What do you think we should do?”—but as one executive I worked with at Apple explained to me, people tend to put their egos into recommendations in a way that can lead to politics, and thus worse decisions. 

So she recommended seeking “facts, not recommendations.” Of course “facts” come inflected with each person’s particular perspective or point of view, but they are less likely to become a line in the sand than a recommendation is.

## Look for the closest people to the facts. 
> If Steve Jobs was making an important decision and wanted to understand some aspect of it more deeply, he’d go right to the person working on it. There were numerous stories about relatively new, young engineers who’d return from lunch to find Steve waiting in their cube, eager to ask them about a specific detail of their work.

## Persuade people, persaude your team.
Expecting others to execute on a decision without being persuaded that it’s the right thing to do is a recipe for terrible results. And don’t imagine that you can step in and simply tell everyone to get in line behind a decision, whether you have made it or somebody else has.

### Acknowledging others' emotions is key for decision making.
> I had a colleague named “Jason” who was responsible for making his product usable for deaf people. He couldn’t have been more passionate about his work—his mother was deaf—but he was unable to persuade the engineering team to prioritize certain key features in time for launch. When I showed him Aristotle’s framework, he exploded. “I don’t know how I could have put any more emotion into my arguments,” he said, his voice choked with frustration. He’d explained to them his personal connection to the project. They’d seemed moved, but they still hadn’t gotten it done. “What were the emotions on the engineering team like?” I asked. “Oh. They were just exhausted. They’d been pulling all-nighters for weeks. It was like a death march over there.” “What did you do to address their emotions?” Jason smacked his forehead, seeing clearly now where he’d gone wrong.
