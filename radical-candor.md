# My notes on Radical Candor

Literally all of this book was valuable, so... notes will be all over the place. Let's go.

# What this book solves

## Management is your job.
> “Is my job to build a great company,” I asked, “or am I really just some sort of emotional babysitter?” Leslie, a fiercely opinionated ex-Microsoft executive, could barely contain herself. “This is not babysitting,” she said. “It’s called management, and it is your job!” Every time I feel I have something more “important” to do than listen to people, I remember Leslie’s words: “It is your job!” I’ve used Leslie’s line on dozens of new managers who’ve come to me after a few weeks in their new role, moaning that they feel like “babysitters” or “shrinks.”

Listening & caring deeply about your employees is your job.

## You are the boss.
> I prefer the word “boss” because the distinctions between leadership and management tend to define leaders as BSers who don’t actually do anything and managers as petty executors. Also, there’s a problematic hierarchical difference implied in the two words, as if leaders no longer have to manage when they achieve a certain level of success, and brand-new managers don’t have to lead.

### You are responsible for your team's results.
> Ultimately, though, bosses are responsible for results. They achieve these results not by doing all the work themselves but by guiding the people on their teams. Bosses guide a team to achieve results.

### This book helps if you face these problems.

- Guidance: People dread feedback—both the praise, which can feel patronizing, and especially the criticism.
- Team-building: Building a cohesive team means figuring out the right people for the right roles: hiring, firing, promoting. But once you’ve got the right people in the right jobs, how do you keep them motivated?
- Results: Many managers are perpetually frustrated that it seems harder than it should be to get things done.

## Your responsibilities as manager.

- Creating a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that keeps the team moving in the right direction.
- Understanding what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredom and keep the team cohesive.
- Driving results collaboratively.

If you think that you can do these things without strong relationships, you are kidding yourself.

Your ability to build trusting, human connections with the people who report directly to you will determine the quality of everything that follows. Defining those relationships is vital. They’re deeply personal, and they’re not like any other relationships in your life. But most of us are at a loss when we set about to build those relationships.

# The dimensions of Radical Candor
- Care personally: giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self and encouraging your direct reports to do the same. 
- Challenge directly: telling people when their work isn't good enough -- and when it is.

Radical Candor is what happens when you put "Care Personally" and "Challenge Directly" together.

## Why is this a good idea?

It turns out that when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to:

1. Accept and act on your praise and criticism
2. Tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well
3. Engage in this same behavior with one another, meaning less pushing the rock up the hill again and again
4. Embrace their role on the team
5. Focus on getting results.

The most surprising thing about Radical Candor may be that its results are often the opposite of what you fear. You fear people will become angry or vindictive; instead they are usually grateful for the chance to talk it through. And even when you do get that initial anger, resentment, or sullenness, those emotions prove to be fleeting when the person knows you really care.

## On "keeping things professional"
Part of the reason why people fail to “care personally” is the injunction to “keep it professional.” That phrase denies something essential. We are all human beings, with human feelings, and, even at work, we need to be seen as such. When that doesn’t happen, when we feel we must repress who we really are to earn a living, we become alienated. That makes us hate going to work. To most bosses, being professional means: show up at work on time, do your job, don’t show feelings (unless engaged in “motivation” or some such end-driven effort). The result is that nobody feels comfortable being who they really are at work.

## Bring your whole self to work.
This often means modeling the behavior yourself by showing some vulnerability to the people who report to you—or just admitting when you’re having a bad day—and creating a safe space for others to do the same.

## Finding humanity @ work.
It’s about acknowledging that we are all people with lives and aspirations that extend beyond those related to our shared work. It’s about finding time for real conversations; about getting to know each other at a human level; about learning what’s important to people; about sharing with one another what makes us want to get out of bed in the morning and go to work—and what has the opposite effect.

## You will invoke emotions.
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell once remarked that being responsible sometimes means pissing people off.

You have to accept that sometimes people on your team will be mad at you. **In fact, if nobody is ever mad at you, you probably aren’t challenging your team enough.** The key, as in any relationship, is how you handle the anger. When what you say hurts, acknowledge the other person’s pain. Don’t pretend it doesn’t hurt or say it “shouldn’t” hurt—just show that you care. 

**Eliminate the phrase “don’t take it personally” from your vocabulary—it’s insulting. Instead, offer to help fix the problem. But don’t pretend it isn’t a problem just to try to make somebody feel better. In the end, caring personally about people even as you challenge them will build the best relationships of your career.**

## Leave behind authoritarianism.
The hardest part of building this trust is inviting people to challenge you, just as directly as you are challenging them. You have to encourage them to challenge you directly enough that you may be the one who feels upset or angry. 

This takes some getting used to—particularly for more “authoritarian” leaders. But if you stick to it, you’ll find that you learn a great deal about yourself and how people perceive you. This knowledge will unfailingly allow you and your team to achieve better results.

## Not a license to be a fucking jerk.
Radical Candor is not a license to be gratuitously harsh or to “front-stab.” It’s not Radical Candor just because you begin with the words, “Let me be Radically Candid with you.” If you follow that phrase with words like, “You are a liar and I don’t trust you,” or “You’re a dipshit,” you’ve just acted like a garden-variety jerk. 

It’s not Radical Candor if you don’t show that you care personally.

## Not a license to suck up.
Radical Candor is not about schmoozing, nor is it about endless extroversion that exhausts the introverts on your team or wears you out if you happen to be the introvert. It’s not about getting drunk or driving go-carts or playing laser tag or having endless dinners with colleagues. Those might be good ways to blow off steam, but activities like that take up a lot of time and are not the most efficient way to help you get to know the people you work with, or show them you care personally.

# Creating a culture of communication

## The `um` story

> “You are going to have an amazing career here at Google,” Sheryl began. She knew how to get my attention—I had three failed start-ups under my belt and badly needed a win. “And your ability to be intellectually honest about both sides of an argument, not just your own, bought you a lot of credibility in there.” She mentioned three or four specific things I’d said to illustrate her point. I’d been worried that I wasn’t arguing my points vehemently enough, so this was welcome news to me.

> She wanted me to register that something I’d been worried about being a weakness was actually a strength. This was interesting, but I wanted to file it away to think about later.

> Sheryl laughed. “You always want to focus on what you could have done better. Which I understand. I do, too. We learn more from failure than success. But I want you to focus for a minute on what went well, because overall it really did go well. This was a success.”

> I listened as best I could. Finally, she said. “You said ‘um’ a lot. Were you aware of it?”

> “Was it because you were nervous? Would you like me to recommend a speech coach for you? Google will pay for it.”

> Sheryl laughed. “When you do that thing with your hand, I feel like you’re ignoring what I’m telling you. I can see I am going to have to be really, really direct to get through to you. You are one of the smartest people I know, but saying ‘um’ so much makes you sound stupid.”

Even though the overall talk had gone well, Sheryl didn’t let the positive result get in the way of pointing out something that needed fixing.

## Show that you care.

When you criticize someone without taking even two seconds to show you care, your guidance feels obnoxiously aggressive to the recipient. I regret to say that if you can’t be Radically Candid, being obnoxiously aggressive is the second best thing you can do.

When bosses criticize others to humiliate them rather than to help them improve, or permit personalized attacks among team members, or discourage praise as “babysitting people’s egos,” their behavior feels obnoxiously aggressive to the people around him.

## Don't be an ass.
The worst kind of Obnoxious Aggression happens when one person really understands another’s vulnerabilities and then targets them, either for sport or to assert dominance. I once had a boss who really knew how to push my buttons—he possessed what I thought of as “cruel empathy.” Almost nothing will erode trust more quickly than using one’s insights into what makes another person tick to hurt them.
