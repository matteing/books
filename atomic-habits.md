# Notes on Atomic Habits
## Thesis
If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
# Chapter 1
## The problem with goals
1. **Winners and losers have the same goals.** We concentrate on the people who end up winning and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all the folks who had the same objective and didn't succeed. Instead, success isn't goalsetting, but system creation.
2. **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.** In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
3. **Goals restrict your happiness.** We often promise ourselves that happiness happens at the end of our goals, when the truth is, it's just delaying it. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.
4. **Goals are at odds with long-term progress.** As soon as you run the end of the marathon, the training stops. People revert to their old habits after accomplishing goals.

# Chapter 2
## Layers of behavior change
There are three layers of behavior change: a change in outcomes, a change in processes, or a change in your identity.

- Outcomes: changing your results.
- Processes: changing your habits & systems.
- Identity: changing your beliefs.

## Where to begin change
Many folks begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they *want* to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we focus first on who we wish to become.

Behavior that is incongruent with the self does not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll be spending rather than earning.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nails to maintain your habit.

- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

## This can also fuck you up
Once an identity is adopted, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. 

- "I'm bad with directions"
- "I'm not a morning person"
- "I'm bad with remembering names"
- "I'm always late"

## Changing your identity
Your habits embody your identity. When you make your bed every day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.

- Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
- Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
- Each time you work out, you are an athlete.
- Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.

You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. However, it works the other way too. If you do bad habits, you also vote for the old identity. 

## The simple two steps
- Decide the type of person you want to be.
- Prove it to yourself with small wins.

### Decide who you want to be.
- Who is the type of person who can lose fourty pounds? 
- Who can learn a new language?
- Who can run a successful start-up?

### Take small steps towards that.
- Question yourself: what would this kind of person do?
- If you act like this person long enough, you become that person.

# Chapter 3
The brain builds habits through a feedback loop: try. fail, learn, try differently. With practice, useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.

Habits do not restrict freedom: instead, they create it. People without habits handled usually have the least freedom.

## The science of how habits work
- Cue: Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
- Craving: The motivational force behind every habit.
- Response: The actual habit you perform.
- Reward: The end goal of every habit.

The four-step loop isn't something that happens occasionally, but rather, it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active every moment you are alive.

You can split this into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase.

### Example

- **Cue:** Your phone buzzes with a text message.
- **Craving:** You want to learn the contents of the message.
- **Response:** You grab your phone and read the text.
- **Reward:** You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with the phone buzzing.

## How to create a good habit.
1. **Cue:** Make it obvious.
2. **Craving:** Make it attractive.
3. **Response:** Make it easy.
4. **Reward:** Make it satisfying.


## How to break a bad habit.
1. **Cue:** Make it invisible.
2. **Craving:** Make it unattractive.
3. **Response:** Make it difficult.
4. **Reward:** Make it unsatisfying.

# Assessing current habits
We are prediction machines. With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. 

## The habit scorecard
One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. We need a system to know how our habits are helping improve us. 

Make a list of your daily habits and ask yourself: is this a good habit or a neutral habit? If it's good, write a `+` sign next to it. Otherwise, write `-`.
If you're having trouble judging how good a habit is, ask yourself: "Does this habit help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote against or for my desired identity?

## Real-life pointing and calling
Say out loud the action that you're thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on junk food but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud: "I'm about to eat this cookie, but I don't need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health."

# How to start a new habit
People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: 

> I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

## Habit stacking
When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

> “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

Habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action should come next. The secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off. (using cues to your advantage)

## Clarity is everything
Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. Specifity helps kick off habits because it brings clarity.

# Building a great environment
A small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. Redesign your environment to make good habits easy and bad habits hard.

Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

Start thinking about your space as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the environment around you. 

## Apples
> I bought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen counter. The next time I bought apples, that was where they went—out in the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than out of sight.

## One space, one use
A powerful way of setting good habits in spaces is "One space, one use". 

When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking.

# Make bad habits invisible
Discipline is hard. You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.

A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

**This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I’m often surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away.**

## On self control
> Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

# Making habits irresistible through dopamine loops
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.

**Dopamine is not only released when you experience pleasure, but when you anticipate it.** It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. 

## Temptation bundling for making habits attractive
Temptation bundling helps similarly to habit stacking. The formula is:

> After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

### Example
> After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).

# Your social circle matters
We pick up habits from the people around us. 

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. 

This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire. 

# Address the underlying motives of bad habits
You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the appropriate response. This all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits because every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive.

A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.

Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.

## Making hard habits attractive
You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience.

A trick: when saying you "have to" do something, change it to "get to". 

## Example

> I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.

## Make a trigger
If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. For instance, if you always play the same song before having sex, then you’ll begin to link the music with the act. Whenever you want to get in the mood, just press play.

You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile.

## Fix the causes of your bad habits
The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.


# Habit products make life easy
If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life.

**Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.**

# Prime your environment
> “When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.”

There are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and utensils you’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy.

## Make bad habits hard
You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make bad behaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too much television, for example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. This setup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.

# The Two-Minute Rule
The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” 

- Two minutes of exercise a day
- Two minutes of reading

This is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing.

## Level it up over time
Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next level.

# Use commitment devices
Change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.

- Make a commitment and go through with it
- Force yourself to actually do it

# Use instant gratification to your advantage
**As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.**

Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. 

> One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled their savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they put the money toward the vacation.

Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. 

# Stick with good habits (The Paperclip Hustle)
> Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.

“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. 

Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.

## Never miss twice
No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your family needs a little more of your time. 

**Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice.**

This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.

# Get external accountability
Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable.

A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. You share it with someone else & the other person must keep you accountable.

## You can automate it!
> Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”


# We all have bad genes, get better
In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity.

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

# The Goldilocks Rule: Get Bored
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty.

But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.

**The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.**

## Add variable reward to your life.
You need "just enough winning" to experience satisfaction and "just enough wanting" to experience desire. Do exciting things every day.

# The downside of good habits
As a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide.

Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve.

Reflect and review your habit performance regularly so you can improve. Make habit reports & "KPI" meetings. You can't optimize what you can't measure. 

# Don't let your desired identity become who you are.
In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.” 

The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. 

If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. 

Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.
