# Notes on Atomic Habits
## Thesis
If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

## The problem with goals
1. **Winners and losers have the same goals.** We concentrate on the people who end up winning and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all the folks who had the same objective and didn't succeed. Instead, success isn't goalsetting, but system creation.
2. **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.** In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
3. **Goals restrict your happiness.** We often promise ourselves that happiness happens at the end of our goals, when the truth is, it's just delaying it. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.
4. **Goals are at odds with long-term progress.** As soon as you run the end of the marathon, the training stops. People revert to their old habits after accomplishing goals.

## Layers of behavior change
There are three layers of behavior change: a change in outcomes, a change in processes, or a change in your identity.

- Outcomes: changing your results.
- Processes: changing your habits & systems.
- Identity: changing your beliefs.

## Where to begin change
Many folks begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they *want* to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we focus first on who we wish to become.

Behavior that is incongruent with the self does not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll be spending rather than earning.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nails to maintain your habit.

- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

## This can also fuck you up
Once an identity is adopted, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. 

- "I'm bad with directions"
- "I'm not a morning person"
- "I'm bad with remembering names"
- "I'm always late"

## Changing your identity
Your habits embody your identity. When you make your bed every day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.

- Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
- Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
- Each time you work out, you are an athlete.
- Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.

You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. However, it works the other way too. If you do bad habits, you also vote for the old identity. 

## The simple two steps
- Decide the type of person you want to be.
- Prove it to yourself with small wins.

### Decide who you want to be.
- Who is the type of person who can lose fourty pounds? 
- Who can learn a new language?
- Who can run a successful start-up?

### Take small steps towards that.
- Question yourself: what would this kind of person do?
- If you act like this person long enough, you become that person.

# Chapter 3
The brain builds habits through a feedback loop: try. fail, learn, try differently. With practice, useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.

Habits do not restrict freedom: instead, they create it. People without habits handled usually have the least freedom.

## The science of how habits work
- Cue: Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
- Craving: The motivational force behind every habit.
- Response: The actual habit you perform.
- Reward: The end goal of every habit.

The four-step loop isn't something that happens occasionally, but rather, it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active every moment you are alive.

You can split this into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase.

### Example

- **Cue:** Your phone buzzes with a text message.
- **Craving:** You want to learn the contents of the message.
- **Response:** You grab your phone and read the text.
- **Reward:** You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with the phone buzzing.

## How to create a good habit.
1. **Cue:** Make it obvious.
2. **Craving:** Make it attractive.
3. **Response:** Make it easy.
4. **Reward:** Make it satisfying.


## How to break a bad habit.
1. **Cue:** Make it invisible.
2. **Craving:** Make it unattractive.
3. **Response:** Make it difficult.
4. **Reward:** Make it unsatisfying.
